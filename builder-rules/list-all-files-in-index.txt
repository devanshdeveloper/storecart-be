STEP BY STEP GUIDE FOR LISTING FILES IN INDEX.JS
TARGET FOLDER : 
TARGET FILE : 
1. ANALYZE PROJECT STRUCTURE
   - Scan the project directory to identify all relevant files
   - Focus on files that need to be exported through index.js
   - Note the file locations and their relative paths

2. IDENTIFY REQUIRED FILES
   - Look for JavaScript/TypeScript files in the directory
   - Exclude test files, configuration files, and temporary files
   - Consider only files that provide functionality or components

3. ORGANIZE FILES ALPHABETICALLY
   - Create a list of all identified files
   - Sort the list alphabetically by filename
   - Maintain consistent naming conventions

4. STRUCTURE THE TARGET FILE
- start by reading the target file
- continue the syntax

7. VERIFY AND TEST
   - Check all import paths are correct
   - Verify all exports are properly named
   - Test the imports in other files
   - Ensure no circular dependencies
